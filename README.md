I successfully set up a virtual machine by first configuring the virtual hardware to match the requirements of the intended application. After allocating sufficient resources such as CPU, memory, and storage, I installed the desired operating system. I then configured network settings and implemented security protocols to ensure optimal performance. This setup now provides a flexible and isolated environment for development and testing purposes.

Once withing my virtual machine I then proceed to enable IIS management console inside windows features. I then install PHP manager for IIS, I run IIS as an administrator and register my PHP manager tool for proper function. My next step is installing the software HeidiSQL and configuring my database to supply osTicket the resources required for suitable operation
